If you're here to see the rankings, please read the information below:
  - The ranking system is not picture perfect, it is based on who you hit
  - If some teams went to 1 easy tournament and cleared, they will have a high elo that cannot be changed until they lose again (this includes temporary partnerships)
  - This list is not official in any way, I debate on the houston circuit and am by no means a coach or alumni
  - The ranking was generated only by computer, no human interaction was used
  - This list is only Houston Teams against Houston Teams, for this reason, most online tournaments will likely be excluded
